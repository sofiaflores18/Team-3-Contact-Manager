## Libraries

As the content of the provided HTML files (`pages/contact.html`, `pages/login.html`, `pages/signup.html`) was not included, it is not possible to definitively identify any external libraries (such as CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, JavaScript libraries like jQuery, or UI component libraries) they might be linking to or utilizing. Typically, such libraries would be referenced via `<link>` tags for stylesheets or `<script>` tags for JavaScript within the HTML document's `<head>` or `<body>`.

The `pages/README.md` file is a documentation file and does not use external libraries in the same manner as code files.

---

### pages/contact.html

This file likely represents the contact page of a web application or website. Its primary purpose is to offer users a form to submit inquiries, feedback, or messages to the site administrators.

**Functions or Methods:**
As this is an HTML file, it defines the structure and content of the page. It does not inherently contain "functions" or "methods" in the programming sense. Any interactive behavior (like form validation or submission handling) would typically be implemented using JavaScript, either embedded within `<script>` tags or linked from external `.js` files, none of which are provided here.

### pages/login.html

This file serves as the login page, providing an interface for existing users to authenticate and access their accounts within the application.

**Functions or Methods:**
Similar to `contact.html`, this HTML file primarily defines the visual layout and input fields for a login form. It does not contain executable functions or methods itself. User authentication logic and client-side form validation would typically be handled by associated JavaScript code (not provided) that interacts with the form elements.

### pages/README.md

This file is a Markdown-formatted README document for the `pages` directory. Its purpose is to provide an overview, instructions, or important information regarding the content or purpose of the HTML files within this specific directory.

**Functions or Methods:**
A `README.md` file is a plain text documentation file and does not contain any code functions or methods. Its content is purely informational.

### pages/signup.html

This file acts as the registration page, enabling new users to create an account within the application. It is designed to collect the necessary information to set up a new user profile.

**Functions or Methods:**
As an HTML file, `signup.html` defines the structure of a user registration form. It does not contain programming functions or methods directly. Client-side validation of input fields and the submission process for creating a new account would typically be managed by accompanying JavaScript code (not provided).
